Dennis DeBar, R-Leakesville, presented an amendment to House Bill 1395 that adds language to raise salaries over the next three years by $6,000 for regular teachers, $2,000 for assistant teachers, $6,000 for licensed special education educators teaching special education classes — plus an additional $3,000 supplement — and $2,000 for college and university educators.\n\n'Today's a good day for teachers, teacher assistants, professors and special education teachers as well,' DeBar told reporters Wednesday after the Senate passed the pay raise. The Senate unanimously passed H.B. 1395."
